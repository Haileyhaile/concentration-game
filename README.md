# Learning Goals
Learning Swift and iOS app development
Creating a project in Xcode

# Required Tasks
1. Have at least 10 cards.
2. Add a “New Game” button to your UI which ends the current game in progress and begins a brand new game.
3. Shuffle the cards in Concentration’s init() method.
4. Give your game the concept of a “theme”. A theme determines the set of emoji from which cards are chosen. All emoji in a given theme are related by that theme.
5. All new UI you add should be nicely laid out and look good in portrait mode on an iPhone X.
